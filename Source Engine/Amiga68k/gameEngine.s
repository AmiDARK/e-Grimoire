; This file is formatted to makes the Source Engine being compiled under any
; Motorola 68k MACRO assembler (like Devpac3 for example) for Amiga OS 1.3-3.x

; *********************************************
; 1. We must firstly include this header file as it contains everything to setup the engine.
;    As assembler will include it at beginning, it will be executed before the 'gameStart' label.
	include	"header_coldStart.s"
; *********************************************
; 2. The main Source Code is located here. It is is the program to run using the Source Engine.
gameEngine:


    rts                                 ; End of the Execution
; Once the "rts" call is done, the 'gameStart' program is finished. Engine will go back to the
; header_coldStart.s to execute methods to release all memories remaining under use on the engine.
